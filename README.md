# Grocery-Sales-Analysis

## Business Use-Case

Try to find ways to increase profit at the Kroger. I have decided to take the approach of looking at how well discounted goods are selling. I believe that discounted goods perform well among our customers because they are affordable for them.

My goal is to look for certain products and goods that aren’t selling well despite heavy discounts. I plan to look into people’s demographics and buying habits to see if there’s a trend or pattern that we can target.

There will be areas of weaknesses that I will have to address with the company. I will provide recommendations on how to improve our operations and to ultimately, maximize profits and consumer satisfaction


## Analytics Approach 

Organizations are always looking for growth opportunities. Unfortunately this can be quite vague and I havee to interpret, identify, and provide my recommendation.  So where do we find growth opportunities? Few questions which i will be looking into 
1. Top 10 product categories sold when they are discounted at more than 50%
2. To understand the shopper behavior, I analyzed total sales volume for various vegetables which are not uniform on monthly basis based on age, household size, household 
   composition and income and product type.
3. I will check (positive or negative) where purchasing behavior is changing over time. Maybe sales volume is increasing for a particular product or customer segment and we could 
  invest in marketing to hopefully compound this trend?
4. Do certain products tend to be purchased with other products on a regular basis?
5. Do certain products have spikes on particular dates (i.e. holidays)?
6. Are certain coupons or promotions more impactful than others?


## Data
I will be  using the Complete Journey to answer my business problem. 

## Insights

I have determined that chicken is our most significant best seller when discounted more than 50%. I considered other products that consumers may purchase along with the chicken and determined that tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and carrots are used a lot when cooking with chicken. It could prove beneficial to look for ways to increase sales of TPOC products.

Below are the demographic groups leaders in purchasing TPOC Discounted Products at higher than 50%:
Age: 45 - 54 years old
Household Size: 2 people
Household Composition: 2 Adults with no kids
Income: 35k - 74k Income Group(s)

Now the bottom demographic group leaders:
Age: 19 - 24
Household Size: 4 people
Household Composition: 1 Adult with Kids
Income: 200k - 249K Income Group

The bottom demographic groups should be considered our target consumers. I will recommend ways to encourage them to purchase more of our discounted products when they are available.

Among the 4 TPOC products, there were some “product_types” that were showing weak revenue levels Kroger. We will have some recommendations to help improve that.


## Recommendation

Based on the trends on various factors mentioned I have two recommendations

### Recommendation 1

Sales team should reach out to the brands that make the:
ONIONS RED (BULK&BAG)
ONIONS WHITE (BULK&BAG)
ONIONS YELLOW (BULK&BAG)
POTATOES RED (BULK&BAG)
TOMATOES CHERRY
ROMA TOMATOES (BULK/PKG)

They should see if the companies that make those products could offer better whole-sale rates if we purchase larger quantities. With more quantity of the products, we can sell more to our target demographics.

### Recommendation 2
TPOC peducts items such as tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and carrots.

To boost monthly revenue for TPOC products, it’s advisable for the marketing team to plan several innovative campaigns throughout the year in March, August, October, and December. These campaigns should offer TPOC products as enticing combos at competitive prices.

Additionally, introducing a targeted coupon mailing and advertising strategy can be highly effective. The sales team should focus on sending coupons to specific demographic groups, including different age segments and marital statuses. By proactively informing our target consumers about ongoing sales and discounts, we aim to increase their interest and likelihood of purchasing TPOC products. This comprehensive approach will help maximize our revenue potential.
