## Grocery-Sales-Analysis

# Business Use-Case

Try to find ways to increase profit at the Kroger. I have decided to take the approach of looking at how well discounted goods are selling. I believe that discounted goods perform well among our customers because they are affordable for them.

My goal is to look for certain products and goods that aren’t selling well despite heavy discounts. I plan to look into people’s demographics and buying habits to see if there’s a trend or pattern that we can target.

There will be areas of weaknesses that I will have to address with the company. I will provide recommendations on how to improve our operations and to ultimately, maximize profits and consumer satisfaction


# Analytics Approach 

Organizations are always looking for growth opportunities. Unfortunately this can be quite vague and I havee to interpret, identify, and provide my recommendation.  So where do we find growth opportunities? Few questions which i will be looking into 

1. Top 10 product categories sold when they are discounted at more than 50%
2. To understand the shopper behavior, I analyzed total sales volume for various vegetables which are not uniform on monthly basis based on age, household size, household composition and income and product type.
3.I will check (positive or negative) where purchasing behavior is changing over time. Maybe sales volume is increasing for a particular product or customer segment and we could invest in marketing to hopefully compound this trend?
4. Do certain products tend to be purchased with other products on a regular basis?
5. Do certain products have spikes on particular dates (i.e. holidays)?
6. Are certain coupons or promotions more impactful than others?
